## Applied Probability: Maximizing `atkAcc`

The first scenario we're going to dicuss is seen quite often (in some form) during the first round of V.P. battles:

```
 1 12 2
```

Here, we have three cogs: a level 1, 12, and 2. Assuming someone chooses to attack the level 12 with a Grand Piano and your two other teammates use Elephant Trunk, what gag should you pick?
 
While your choice in this particular situation may seem somewhat unimportant, understanding the best play here could prove vital in more complicated scenarios. (Hint: there are [two](https://github.com/QED1224/Toontown-Resources#misc-2) [relevant](https://github.com/QED1224/Toontown-Resources#bonus-) sections in the main guide.)

*Assumptions*: Everyone has maxed gags and you're Dropless.

**Solution**
